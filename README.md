Ever wanted a fake non-existing version number of PHP, well this package is for you!

## Install ##

To install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), use the command below, it will automatically detect the latest version and bind it with `~`.

```
composer require wyrihaximus/fake-php-version 
```

## Available constants ##

* `WyriHaximus\FakePHPVersion\Versions::FUTURE` - Version in the next mayor version of PHP e.g. 8.98.9001
* `WyriHaximus\FakePHPVersion\Versions::CURRENT` - Version in the current mayor version of PHP e.g. 7.133.666
* `WyriHaximus\FakePHPVersion\Versions::ACTUAL` - Actual current version of PHP

The `WyriHaximus\FakePHPVersion\FUTURE`, `WyriHaximus\FakePHPVersion\Versions::CURRENT`, and 
`WyriHaximus\FakePHPVersion\Versions::ACTUAL` constants are still available but deprecated. v2 will drop them and be 
`Versions` class only.
